## There are 5 major constraints are used in SQL, such as

    NOT NULL: That indicates that the column must have some value and cannot be left null
    UNIQUE: This constraint is used to ensure that each row and column has unique value and no value is being repeated in any other row or column
    PRIMARY KEY: This constraint is used in association with NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints such as on one or the combination of more than one columns to identify the particular record with a unique identity.
    FOREIGN KEY: It is used to ensure the referential integrity of data in the table and also matches the value in one table with another using Primary Key
    CHECK: It is used to ensure whether the value in columns fulfills the specified condition
	
	
## What is CTE?

A CTE or common table expression is an expression which contains temporary result set which is defined in a SQL statement.

		WITH Employee_CTE (EmployeeNumber, Title)
		AS
		(
			SELECT NationalIDNumber, JobTitle
			FROM   Employee
		)
		SELECT EmployeeNumber,Title
		FROM   Employee_CTE

## What are the properties of a transaction?

Generally, these properties are referred to as ACID properties. They are:

    Atomicity
    Consistency
    Isolation
    Durability.	

	
## What is a Cursor?

A cursor is a database object which is used to manipulate data in a row-to-row manner.

Cursor follows steps as given below

    Declare Cursor
    Open Cursor
    Retrieve row from the Cursor
    Process the row
    Close Cursor
    Deallocate Cursor

	
## What is Normalization? How many Normalization forms are there?

Normalization is used to organize the data in such manner that data redundancy will never occur in the database and avoid insert, update and delete anomalies.

There are 5 forms of Normalization

    First Normal Form (1NF): It removes all duplicate columns from the table. Creates a table for related data and identifies unique column values
    First Normal Form (2NF): Follows 1NF and creates and places data subsets in an individual table and defines the relationship between tables using the primary key
    Third Normal Form (3NF): Follows 2NF and removes those columns which are not related through primary key
    Fourth Normal Form (4NF): Follows 3NF and do not define multi-valued dependencies. 4NF also known as BCNF
	
	
## What is the Cartesian product of table?

The output of Cross Join is called as a Cartesian product.
 It returns rows combining each row from the first table with each row of the second table. 
 
For Example, if we join two tables having 15 and 20 columns the Cartesian product of two tables will be 15×20=300 Rows.


##What is Self-Join?

Self-join is set to be query used to compare to itself. 


## What are transaction and its controls?

In simple word, we can say that a transaction means a group of SQL queries executed on database records.

There are 4 transaction controls such as

    COMMIT: It is used to save all changes made through the transaction
    ROLLBACK: It is used to roll back the transaction such as all changes made by the transaction are reverted back and database remains as before
    SET TRANSACTION: Set the name of transaction
    SAVEPOINT: It is used to set the point from where the transaction is to be rolled back
	
	
##What is a View?

A view is a virtual table which consists of a subset of data contained in a table. 
Views are not virtually present, and it takes less space to store. View can have data of one or more tables combined, 
and it is depending on the relationship. 


##What is subquery?

A subquery is a query within another query. The outer query is called as main query,
and inner query is called subquery. SubQuery is always executed first, and the result of subquery is passed on to the main query. 

##What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE commands?

## What is data Integrity?

Data Integrity defines the accuracy and consistency of data stored in a database. 


## What is collation?

Collation is defined as set of rules that determine how character data can be sorted and compared. 

This can be used to compare A and, other language characters and also depends on the width of the characters.

ASCII value can be used to compare these character data. 


##What is recursive stored procedure?

A stored procedure which calls by itself until it reaches some boundary condition. 
This recursive function or procedure helps programmers to use the same set of code any number of times. 


##What is Union, minus and Interact commands?

UNION operator is used to combine the results of two tables, and it eliminates duplicate rows from the tables.

MINUS operator is used to return rows from the first query but not from the second query. Matching records of first 
and second query and other rows from the first query will be displayed as a result set.

INTERSECT operator is used to return rows returned by both the queries. 


## What are aggregate and scalar functions?

Aggregate functions are used to evaluate mathematical calculation and return single values. 
This can be calculated from the columns in a table. 
Scalar functions return a single value based on the input value.

Example -.

Aggregate – max(), count - Calculated with respect to numeric.

Scalar – UCASE(), NOW() – Calculated with respect to strings. 


## User-defined Functions?

- User-defined functions cannot be used to perform actions that modify the database state.

- User-defined functions cannot contain an OUTPUT INTO clause that has a table as its target.

- User-defined functions can not return multiple result sets. Use a stored procedure if you need to return multiple result sets.

- Error handling is restricted in a user-defined function. A UDF does not support TRY...CATCH, @ERROR or RAISERROR.


##  Local Variable:

The scope or lifetime of the local variable is within a block or procedure..

E.g.: DECLARE @Variable1

## Global Variable:

The scope or lifetime of the global Variable throughout the execution of the program.

E.g.: DECLARE @@Variable1
 
 

## Table variables (DECLARE @t TABLE) are visible only to the connection that creates it, and are deleted when the batch or stored procedure ends.

## Local temporary tables (CREATE TABLE #t) are visible only to the connection that creates it, and are deleted when the connection is closed.

## Global temporary tables (CREATE TABLE ##t) are visible to everyone, and are deleted when all connections that have referenced them have closed.

## Tempdb permanent tables (USE tempdb CREATE TABLE t) are visible to everyone, and are deleted when the server is restarted.



##What is COALESCE in SQL Server?

COALESCE is used to return first non-null expression within the arguments. This function is used to return a non-null from more than one column in the arguments.

Example – Select COALESCE(empno, empname, salary) from employee;


##What are Magic Tables in SQL Server?

Insert and Delete tables are created when the trigger is fired for any DML command. Those tables are called Magic Tables in SQL Server. 
These magic tables are used inside the triggers for data transaction.
